# Beyond the magnetic field of a finite wire

Code to compute the magnetic field of different geometries using the finite-wire approach.
The notebook uses a hybrid methodology to evaluated the magnitude of the magnetic field of different shapes (designed by the user/student).
It uses an iterative method based on the analytical solution of the traditional exercise of finding the magnetic field created by a current carrying wire.

This Jupyter notebook reproduce all figures of the paper ***"Beyond the magnetic field of a finite wire: a teaching approach using the superposition principle"*** by García-Farieta & A. Hurtado-Márquez (2021) published in *The Physics Teacher* journal (Vol. 59, 2021).
